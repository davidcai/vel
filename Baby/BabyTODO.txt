Healthy Beginnings baby article to always show first.

Governor interface:
home screen: show stats (num article per section,city, etc.).
hb editor:
- list page to break/sort articles by week range
Resources: page to view/edit/lock the content of an article. (for author)
on crawl of resources, need to remove ones that are no longer relevant. Delete all before crawl?

ArticleStore: caching for all queries. Clear after save/remove.
automatic cached query using DatabeanStore.cachedQuery(). clear all on remove and store.
Need smarter cache indexing. allowing multiple keys for invalidation. using naming convention with x|y|z.
  convention for db: Table.ColA=ValA|Table.ColB=ValB|Table.ColC=* . Clear on Save (for dirty columns) and Remove (must load object for that).

Info list pages (HB, resources): Search box.

(2) BACK BREADCRUMBS: Need _back_ functionality. support chaining? Look into window.session store. see http://code.google.com/p/sessionstorage/

ASK what it takes to demo the app w/o publication. Do we need apple dev acct or can he do it from his end?

brent feedback:
journal: timeline across the top
pinkpad app calendar with icons: day, month, list views.
categories for articles. can then let user browser by category.

Checklists (mom form)
- improve design style
- collapse lists with >>. send via ajax
+ Content tab: do not list user defined checklists
+ Mom's page: show checklists from the past, i.e. ignore timeline to.
+ "remove" doesn't work

Dr visits:
- make part of journal
- attach checklists to a visit based on timeline. including: birth plan.
- attach suggested questions(article) to a visit based on timeline.

Integrate the "Birth plan". It's a document the mother should fill out and send to her doctor.
can be done electronically, or printed/mailed to doctor.

print capability of the journal. or export to PDF.

kick counter: special screen with timer of 60 seconds to help mom count. button counter.

compressed "upload only" version of image upload control: don't show thumbnail, don't show "upload new", size.
allow to pass in the imagesize spec string for the thumbnail. Can then make it 32x32.

design "notebook" style for journal. lines, margins, etc.
