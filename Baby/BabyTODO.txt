SAMOYAN:

automatic cached query using DatabeanStore.cachedQuery(). clear all on remove and store.
Need smarter cache indexing. allowing multiple keys for invalidation. using naming convention with x|y|z.
  convention for db: Table.ColA=ValA|Table.ColB=ValB|Table.ColC=* . Clear on Save (for dirty columns) and Remove (must load object for that).
  see http://code.google.com/p/concurrentlinkedhashmap/
  see http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/
- leverage CSS3 transitions for animation effects on (e.g.) mouseover.
  see www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_transitions.asp
  see http://www.mobilerevamp.org/2011/07/02/ios-devices-and-page-transitions/
= Simplify alert timeline.
  - eliminate concept of delay
  - screen to let user choose channels per notif.
  - let admin define defaults per notif type.
  - somehow need to get list of notif types with titles.
= Leverage foreign keys with optionally ON DELETE CASCADE to keep references in DB.
  create the FK's in controller startup
  remove the DB events (onBeforeSave, etc.)
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6260688/sql-server-cascade-delete
  MAY NOT WORK because when deleting beans, we also need to clear caches
  Also not a good idea if wanting to support BigData databases
- leverage HTML application cache (manifest)
- alert admin before APN or Tomcat's certificates expire
= APPLE PUSH:
  - alert timeline page, contact info page: for apple notifs, "enable" link to go to a page that explains how to download the app, and enable notifications.
    do not link directly to the app store.
  - BADGE#: figure out how to calculate badge number.
    need to push new "badge" notif when badge# changes in backend.
    need to keep "open" status on notifs/events.
- Make DB layer compatible with BigData db. http://cassandra.apache.org/
= GoBACK:
  = Improve goback redirection: GoBack page with JS is slow and flickers
    - always post the top of the stack in a _goback_ param.
      must be done after pushing, popping; after DOM is ready.
    - when doing a GoBack redirection, redirect to that URL instead of to the GoBack page.
      - pass param to the page to prevent it being pushed on the stack again. pop the stack accordingly. _backpop_ or similar.
  = when pushing on stack, check history.length. if same as during prev push, may indicate that the browser's back button was pressed.
    clear back stack if history.size hasn't changed?
    not necessarily correct. history.length can remain the same if pressed back, then click on link to navigate forward again.
  ? GoBackPage: need to redirect to SELF if BACK stack is empty. when can this happen? after clearing BACK stack? 
= Mobile UI:
  - support for ... MORE in tab bar if there are too many tabs
  = MENU item:
    - show login/logout/register/help/copyright/terms links in nav bar.
    - MENU button to work like in Gmail/FB apps: slide the body to the left, reveal menu underneath.
    - different bg color for navbar
    - navbar style to be like WideLinkGroupControl.
  _ Mobile HotAction area (top-right corner buttons) to support search input box: widen on focus
  - detect orientation change, set class on BODY tag. in iOS, do same trick a scrollTo to recalc width of fixed elements.
= name all threads in pools: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6113746/naming-threads-and-thread-pools-of-executorservice
-? ServerStore.fed() and .local() to reload once per 1 second, otherwise use local cache.
  can then move more settings into fed (cookie exp, debug, session, etc.)
- create samoyan ConsoldiatedProfilePage, also for MMM and eLert.
= simplify registration, esp for mobile. ask for email, password only.
  create username from email address, and send email with it to user.
  general setting: simple self-registration, full self-registration, by invitation only
  in simple registration, do not allow signing up for multiple accounts on same email address.
  also need to check when changing email addresses in email form.
  also change title in login control to "Email" from login ID.
  also hide the "Rename account" page.
- SpriteControl:
  - accept large image, width/height
  - set coords to show
  - set coords to show on hover
  - animation sequence + speed
= disallow uploading of large files. set limit to ? MB.
- photo coming 90 degrees wrong way when uploaded from mobile device. Need to detect orientation when uploading image

BABY

? refactor package names to match UI.
  also COMMAND consts in BabyPage
  also .properties file names
  also uri filters in bottom of baby.less (for hiding navbar)

= (0) Content:
  = send new content to Andi. need to extract from XL, unlock.
  = sample youtube videos of tours of facilities. search for "kaiser permanente maternity tour" on youtube
  = add hyperlinks for preconception checklist that speaks of medical conditions.
    may need an article that will link to all other articles.
- notifs:
  - check iPhone app + push notifs
  - alert timeline to allow user to choose channels, but no delay
= enable all channels on PROD. user friendly email address. now using gmail.
- mybabyandi.com expires Feb 8. Try to grab if not renewed, otherwise, contact for purchase.
_ MyElert mobile. getting logged out without a reason. check why!
  happens with debug=false, ssl=true and only on demo.veloxicom.com. and only with chrome emulation (not with actual iphone)
  check all usage of debug related to session management or cookies.
- discussion forums. provide estimate
= Edit/remove for my personal checklist items (same as journal entries)
= Figure out how to redirect to error page, but only for HTML requests. esp for 500 and 404.
  - getting error 400 (bad request due to XSS protection) on login when cookies are disabled.
    disable login control if no cookies header.
- bad layout when rotating iphone (width changes)
= (1) interactive birth-plan / questionnaire documents.
+ double check that crawler does not delete articles that are not created by itself (check flag)
? In "suggested reading", break articles by subsection and insert header


Erica's input:
= Back button showing on home screen. need way to reset stack when logging in, or for particular screens.
  after logout, after login.
  - keep back stack on server. pass window ID in cookie so can add/remove to correct stack.
  - then can render correct <- or = button in top-left without JS trick
  - can then also clear stack in init proc of page
= "Add to home screen" popup window for iphone/Android. show once. use app storage. not if cordova user-agent.
  depends also on browser. Can be chrome on ios...
  need to detect if already added to home screen (e.g. running as web app already)
- NTH: Add a new TODO item from calendar, with date.
  personal checkitems to have due date.

DAVID:
= (1) Journal UI:
  = more results with AJAX (pagination)
  = long word with no spaces in journal entry: no wrapping. CSS: word-wrap:break-word;
  = journal entry: show first 256 chars with More>> link if necessary. Use ExpandableTextControl.
= (0) New measurement page:
  - don't show Remove button, don't show text+image edit boxes
  - add date field. defaults to today
    - always post in current time of day
  - title should not say "journal"
= Charts page:
  normalization range in weight chart.
  based on orig weight before pregnancy.
  legend for this graph.
=? (2) Appointment view/edit page should show the relevant (based on type and timeline) checklists and articles
= (3) Hover for editing journal doesn't work well on iPad (desktop UI but with touch)
= (4) Calendar to include icons marking checklist deadlines.
- print capability of the journal. or export to PDF.
  design "notebook" style for journal. lines, margins, etc.
- separate Day and TimeOfDay input controls to return Day and TimeOfDay
  - drop downs when not supported natively.
  - allow setting step for TimeOfDay (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min)
  - auto adjust max days of month dropdown (jan 31, feb 28/29, etc.)
  - getParameterDay, getParameterTimeOfDay
  - getParameterDayAndTime("day", "time", tz) to return Date
  - in appointments, use Day+TimeOfDay controls instead of custom dropdowns. print time zone.

PHASE II:

_ checklists from earlier stages (preconception, pregnancy): show as faded.
- Integrate the "Birth plan". It's a document the mother should fill out and send to her doctor.
  can be done electronically, or printed/mailed to doctor.
- ArticleStore:
  - caching for all queries/searches. Clear after save/remove.
- kick counter tool:
  - integrate into measures (link to the tool)
  - better design
  - May need to redo because kicks are counted on several min basis. (how long to reach 10 kicks)
_ Horizontal navigation (tab):
  - set Fixed to top. need solid bg. Padding at bottom should not be fixed.
  - error message to show below navigation

FUTURE IDEAS:

- Allow user to create reminder for personal checkitems. 

- Help pages
- Contact us page

- Promote books for sale on Amazon. Collect commission via Amazon Associates program (approx 7%)
  as simple as publishing article with link to Amazon
- Discussion forums tab.
- Count hits on popular articles.
- Ratings of articles (5 star system), comments.
- Tool for calculating time between contractions

INTERNAL MESSAGING:

+ InternalMessages table: id, subject, fromUserID, toUserID, date created, read flag, important flag, content (html), attachments, threadID.
+ Compose new msg page.
  + typeahed for users
  + prevent sending to same user more than once
+ Multiple recipients: need InternalMessageRecipients table with InternalMessageID (ownedby), RecipientUserID (refers to), DeletedFlag.
- View message
  - show conversation/thread trail, including outgoing msgs. excluding deleted msgs.
  + show sender + avatar, recipient list, subject, date
  + validate user is on recipient list
  + links/icons to reply/reply all/forward
  + blockquote should be styled
  - option to delete one msg in thread.
- FFpage functionality later.
  - option to restrict recipient typeahead
  - support dynamic content as element of msg (via iframe?). then can have action buttons and use as My eLert Wall.
- Inbox page.
  - render in conversation view.
    - date should be of last incoming msg (not deleted)
    - title should exclude the "Re:" or "Fwd:".
    - num should be total msg count in thread, including outgoing, but not deleted ones.
  - option to render as Wall with bubbles
  - option to render in chronological view
+ Notifications (SMS, voice, email): "you have a message on My eLert, login to view"
= Admin AdHoc page: add "Inbox" as option. No need to send out notifs.
- Internal msg to be added as channel to timeline.
- Where to place link to inbox?
