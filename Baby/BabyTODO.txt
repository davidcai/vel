SAMOYAN:

automatic cached query using DatabeanStore.cachedQuery(). clear all on remove and store.
Need smarter cache indexing. allowing multiple keys for invalidation. using naming convention with x|y|z.
  convention for db: Table.ColA=ValA|Table.ColB=ValB|Table.ColC=* . Clear on Save (for dirty columns) and Remove (must load object for that).
  see http://code.google.com/p/concurrentlinkedhashmap/
  see http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/
- leverage CSS3 transitions for animation effects on (e.g.) mouseover.
  see www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_transitions.asp
  see http://www.mobilerevamp.org/2011/07/02/ios-devices-and-page-transitions/
= Simplify alert timeline.
  - eliminate concept of delay
  - screen to let user choose channels per notif.
  - let admin define defaults per notif type.
  - somehow need to get list of notif types with titles.
= Leverage foreign keys with optionally ON DELETE CASCADE to keep references in DB.
  create the FK's in controller startup
  remove the DB events (onBeforeSave, etc.)
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6260688/sql-server-cascade-delete
  MAY NOT WORK because when deleting beans, we also need to clear caches
  Also not a good idea if wanting to support BigData databases
- leverage HTML application cache (manifest)
- alert admin before APN or Tomcat's certificates expire
= APPLE PUSH:
  - alert timeline page, contact info page: for apple notifs, "enable" link to go to a page that explains how to download the app, and enable notifications.
    do not link directly to the app store.
  - BADGE#: figure out how to calculate badge number.
    need to push new "badge" notif when badge# changes in backend.
    need to keep "open" status on notifs/events.
- Make DB layer compatible with BigData db. http://cassandra.apache.org/
= GoBACK:
  = Improve goback redirection: GoBack page with JS is slow and flickers
    - always post the top of the stack in a _goback_ param.
      must be done after pushing, popping; after DOM is ready.
    - when doing a GoBack redirection, redirect to that URL instead of to the GoBack page.
      - pass param to the page to prevent it being pushed on the stack again. pop the stack accordingly. _backpop_ or similar.
  = when pushing on stack, check history.length. if same as during prev push, may indicate that the browser's back button was pressed.
    clear back stack if history.size hasn't changed?
    not necessarily correct. history.length can remain the same if pressed back, then click on link to navigate forward again.
  ? GoBackPage: need to redirect to SELF if BACK stack is empty. when can this happen? after clearing BACK stack? 
= Mobile UI:
  - support for ... MORE in tab bar if there are too many tabs
  = MENU item:
    - show login/logout/register/help/copyright/terms links in nav bar.
    - MENU button to work like in Gmail/FB apps: slide the body to the left, reveal menu underneath.
    - different bg color for navbar
    - navbar style to be like WideLinkGroupControl.
  _ Mobile HotAction area (top-right corner buttons) to support search input box: widen on focus
  - detect orientation change, set class on BODY tag. in iOS, do same trick a scrollTo to recalc width of fixed elements.

BABY

? refactor package names to match UI.
  also COMMAND consts in BabyPage
  also .properties file names
  also uri filters in bottom of baby.less (for hiding navbar)

= margin on smartphone ui.
  > * {margin: 0px 5px}
  .FullWidth {margin: 0px 0px}
  TABLE.NoPadding > TBODY > TR > TD {padding: 0px;}
  #page {padding: 0px;} but H1 {padding-top: 15px;}
- ArticleListControl:
  ? don't show HR divider on Computer ui
= slider control for timeline instead of dropdown
= Content:
  = send new content to Andi. need to extract from XL, unlock.
  = sample youtube videos of tours of facilities. search for "kaiser permanente maternity tour" on youtube
= notifs:
  = check iPhone app + push notifs
  = alert timeline to allow user to choose channels, but no delay
= enable all channels on PROD. email is currently disabled, and enabled on my dev system
= mybabyandi.com expires Feb 8. Try to grab if not renewed, otherwise, contact for purchase.
= Journal:
  - UI of Journal list
    - better rendering of items in list, widelinkgroup with >
    - more results with AJAX
  - edit screen of journal entry (without measures for now)
  - reduce image size to 50x50 on mobile. also in Article list.
    create standard thumbnail sizes: 50x50 and 32x32 in samoyan
- create system ConsoldiatedProfilePage, also for MMM and eLert.
= simplify registration, esp for mobile. ask for email, password only.
  create username from email address, and send email with it to user.
  general setting: simple self-registration, full self-registration, by invitation only
  in simple registration, do not allow signing up for multiple accounts on same email address.
  also need to check when changing email addresses in email form.
  also change title in login control to "Email" from login ID.
  also hide the "Rename account" page.
= galaxy asking for http://mybaby.veloxicom.com/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png and http://mybaby.veloxicom.com/apple-touch-icon.png
  and repeating on every request if not found.
  debug with david.
- Figure out how to redirect to error page, but only for HTML requests. esp for 500 and 404.
- MyElert mobile. getting logged out without a reason. check why!
  happens with debug=false, ssl=true and only on demo.veloxicom.com. and only with chrome emulation (not with actual iphone)
  check all usage of debug related to session management or cookies.
= server won't shutdown quickly sometimes. added debug statements to controller.terminate. Deploy on all projects, and check logs.
-? ServerStore.fed() and .local() to reload once per 1 second, otherwise use local cache.
  can then move more settings into fed (cookie exp, debug, session, etc.)

Erica's feedback Jan 4:
- NTH: Add a new TODO item from calendar, with date.
  personal checkitems to have due date.
- Evaluate two-tier top-level nav bar rather than vertical nav bar.
=? hide navigation bar on desktop, for non-admin tabs
  widen main body to full width, have tab control for journey tab

- UI design / ask Erica:
  - calendar control is a bit of an overkill for only showing appointments. maybe it's better to show only in list view.
    - show icons of journal entries (text, img, measure) in calendar?
      but calendar is now tied to appointments with + button
  - list view of calendar: wasteful in vertical space for day headers. unlikely to have more than one appointment per day.
    we changed it to be more compact
  - square logo design on various backgrounds (also for app icon).
  - journal entry list UI on desktop. How to render?
  - View appointment page: layout is very bare. Add labels?
  - how to render checklists:
    - fade out or hide if from previous stage?
    - overdue/complete flags
  - What do you want to see on the Master ROOT page when logged in?
  - smaller thumbnails in lists on mobile?
  - change "My schedule" label -> "My appointments" ?

? Master root page when logged in:
  - Link to Help pages
  - About the app
  - Copyright/terms
  - If emergency, call 911...
  - Contact us page


PHASE II:

_ checklists from earlier stages (preconception, pregnancy): show as faded.
- Integrate the "Birth plan". It's a document the mother should fill out and send to her doctor.
  can be done electronically, or printed/mailed to doctor.
- ArticleStore: caching for all queries/searches. Clear after save/remove.
  warm up cache on system load: load all articles/checklists to memory
- kick counter tool:
  - integrate into measures (link to the tool)
  - better design
  - May need to redo because kicks are counted on several min basis. (how long to reach 10 kicks)
_ Horizontal navigation (tab):
  - set Fixed to top. need solid bg. Padding at bottom should not be fixed.
  - error message to show below navigation

DAVID:
= Appointment view/edit page should show the relevant (based on type and timeline) checklists and articles
= Calendar to include icons marking checklist deadlines.
= Link measures with Journal entries
  = journal page: cleanup look, show image+text+measures
= print capability of the journal. or export to PDF.
  design "notebook" style for journal. lines, margins, etc.
- separate Day and TimeOfDay input controls to return Day and TimeOfDay
  - drop downs when not supported natively.
  - allow setting step for TimeOfDay (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min)
  - auto adjust max days of month dropdown (jan 31, feb 28/29, etc.)
  - getParameterDay, getParameterTimeOfDay
  - getParameterDayAndTime("day", "time", tz) to return Date
  - in appointments, use Day+TimeOfDay controls instead of custom dropdowns. print time zone.


FUTURE IDEAS:

- Promote books for sale on Amazon. Collect commission via Amazon Associates program (approx 7%)
  as simple as publishing article with link to Amazon
- Discussion forums tab.
- Count hits on popular articles.
- Ratings of articles (5 star system), comments.
- Tool for calculating time between contractions

INTERNAL MESSAGING:

+ InternalMessages table: id, subject, fromUserID, toUserID, date created, read flag, important flag, content (html), attachments, threadID.
+ Compose new msg page.
  + typeahed for users
  + prevent sending to same user more than once
+ Multiple recipients: need InternalMessageRecipients table with InternalMessageID (ownedby), RecipientUserID (refers to), DeletedFlag.
- View message
  - show conversation/thread trail, including outgoing msgs. excluding deleted msgs.
  + show sender + avatar, recipient list, subject, date
  + validate user is on recipient list
  + links/icons to reply/reply all/forward
  + blockquote should be styled
  - option to delete one msg in thread.
- FFpage functionality later.
  - option to restrict recipient typeahead
  - support dynamic content as element of msg (via iframe?). then can have action buttons and use as My eLert Wall.
- Inbox page.
  - render in conversation view.
    - date should be of last incoming msg (not deleted)
    - title should exclude the "Re:" or "Fwd:".
    - num should be total msg count in thread, including outgoing, but not deleted ones.
  - option to render as Wall with bubbles
  - option to render in chronological view
+ Notifications (SMS, voice, email): "you have a message on My eLert, login to view"
= Admin AdHoc page: add "Inbox" as option. No need to send out notifs.
- Internal msg to be added as channel to timeline.
- Where to place link to inbox?
