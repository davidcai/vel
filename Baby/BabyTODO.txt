Healthy Beginnings baby article to always show first.

Governor interface:
home screen: show stats (num article per section,city, etc.).
hb editor:
- list page to break/sort articles by week range
Resources: page to view/edit/lock the content of an article. (for author)
on crawl of resources, need to remove ones that are no longer relevant. Delete all before crawl?

ArticleStore: caching for all queries. Clear after save/remove.
automatic cached query using DatabeanStore.cachedQuery(). clear all on remove and store.
Need smarter cache indexing. allowing multiple keys for invalidation. using naming convention with x|y|z.
  convention for db: Table.ColA=ValA|Table.ColB=ValB|Table.ColC=* . Clear on Save (for dirty columns) and Remove (must load object for that).

Info list pages (HB, resources): Search box.

+ user admin screen: typeahead for carrier, remove verified checkboxes. check that carrier matches country.
+ New My Baby and I logo
+ BACK BREADCRUMBS:
  + would be nice to be able to pass title of back page. e.g. _backtitle_
    if not present, use default "Back" or whatever is passed into writeBackButton
  + Support goBackException to use JS to pop stack. implement in Profile pages.
  + writeBackButton(id):
    if _back_ param, then call js pushBackHistory(_back_, id) - only push if top of stack is not same id
    write button hidden. show it with js if stack is not empty and top of stack==id
    on click, pop from stack, redirect.
= (0) Redo iPhone UI:
  - title bar, tab bars, buttons: fixed. scrollable center.
    try to avoid using fixed positioning. try table with height=100% and scrollable center.
    better location for menu bar. = icon in top bar to show the menu, hide the page, tabbar, back button.
    smaller icons in tabbar (24px?)
  - TwoCol: round cornered group of elements. see http://www.diffen.com/difference/Capex_vs_Opex for nice style
    support > links for rows.
    - Reimplement Profile page as list of properties with links to edit screens. Then no need for Profile Tab. but then, where to place link to settings? under name of user in nav bar?
      use new Back button to return to previous screen
  - shrink size of tab icons, if n X 48 > width.
  - buttons fixed to top. use jQuery to move Save/Back buttons to title bar.

ASK what it takes to demo the app w/o publication. Do we need apple dev acct or can he do it from his end?

brent feedback:
journal: timeline across the top
pinkpad app calendar with icons: day, month, list views.
categories for articles. can then let user browser by category.

Checklists (mom form)
- improve design style
- collapse lists with >>. send via ajax

Dr visits:
- make part of journal
- attach checklists to a visit based on timeline. including: birth plan.
- attach suggested questions(article) to a visit based on timeline.

Integrate the "Birth plan". It's a document the mother should fill out and send to her doctor.
can be done electronically, or printed/mailed to doctor.

print capability of the journal. or export to PDF.

kick counter: special screen with timer of 60 seconds to help mom count. button counter.

compressed "upload only" version of image upload control: don't show thumbnail, don't show "upload new", size.
allow to pass in the imagesize spec string for the thumbnail. Can then make it 32x32.

design "notebook" style for journal. lines, margins, etc.

guided setup

INTERNAL MESSAGING:
+ InternalMessages table: id, subject, fromUserID, toUserID, date created, read flag, important flag, content (html), attachments, threadID.
+ Compose new msg page.
