<h2>Website Privacy Statement</h2>

Use and disclosure of health information includes using the information to provide treatment to the individual, to make payments for such treatment, and to conduct ongoing quality improvement activities. Our use and disclosure of an individual's personal information (including health information) is limited as required by state and federal law. We do not sell or rent personal information about visitors to this site or customers who use the site.<p>

This Web site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control.  These measures include encryption of data using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) system, and using a secured messaging service when we send you personal information electronically.  Despite these measures, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from us via this site by Internet or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. At your discretion, you may contact us at the mailing address or telephone number listed in the "Questions, complaints, and contacts" section at the end of this Privacy Statement.

<h2>Revisions to the Privacy Statement</h2>

We may revise this Privacy Statement from time to time as we add new features or as laws change that may affect our services. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we will post notice of this on our website. Any revised Privacy Statement will apply both to information we already have about you at the time of the change, and any personal information created or received after the change takes effect. We include a version number on this Privacy Statement consisting of the date (year, month, and day) it was last revised. We encourage you to periodically reread this Privacy Statement, to see if there have been any changes to our policies that may affect you.

<h2>Website visitor data</h2>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> routinely gathers data on website and mobile application activity, such as how many people visit the site or mobile application, the web pages or mobile screens they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, etc. The data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means that no personally identifiable information is associated with the data. This data helps us improve our content and overall usage. The information is not shared with other organizations for their independent use.

<h2>Collecting and using personal information</h2>

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not collect any identifiable information about visitors to this site. The policies, sources, and uses of information are outlined in Section 1 through 9 that follow:

<h2>1. Web logs</h2>

We maintain standard Web logs that record data about all visitors and customers who use this site and we store this information for a while. These logs may contain the Internet domain from which you access the site (such as aol.com, abc.org, etc.); the IP address which is automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the Internet (a static IP address may be identifiable as being connected to you, while a dynamic address is usually not identifiable); the type of browser and operating system you use; the date and time you visited; the pages or mobile screens you viewed; the address of the website you linked from, if any. If you sign on to this website to use secured features, our Web logs will also contain an individual identifier and show the services you have accessed.<p>

All Web logs are stored securely, and may only be accessed by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> employees or designees on a need-to-know basis for a specific purpose. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> uses Web log information to help us design our site, to identify popular features, to resolve user, hardware, and software problems, and to make the site more useful to visitors.

<h2>2. Internet cookies</h2>

We may place Internet "cookies" on the computer hard drives of visitors to this <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> website. Information we obtain from cookies helps us to tailor our site to be more helpful and efficient for our visitors. The cookie consists of a unique identifier that does not contain information about you. We use two types of cookies, "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.<p>

A session cookie is temporary, and expires after you end a session and close your web browser. We use session cookies to help customize your experience on our site, maintain your signed-on status as you navigate through our features, and to track your "click path" through our Web pages or mobile screens.<p>

Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive after you've exited from our website, and we use them for several reasons. For instance, when you give us permission to "remember" a feature about you when asked by the website, such as your <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> region, we place a persistent cookie on your hard drive so that the next time you visit us, we won't have to ask you that information again. If you've given us permission to e-mail you with information about your <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> benefits, or for other reasons, we may place a persistent cookie on your hard drive that will let us know when you come back to visit our site. We sometimes use this type of persistent cookie with a "Web beacon" (see below). Persistent cookies will not contain any personal information about you.<p>

You may have software on your computer that will allow you to decline or deactivate Internet cookies, but if you do so, some features of this site may not work properly for you. For instructions on how to remove cookies from your hard drive, go to your browser's website for detailed instructions. In addition, further information regarding cookies may be available on other websites or from your Internet service provider. Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and iOS browsers are commonly used browsers.<p>

We use Google Analytics (with information sharing disabled) to track and analyzes how visitors interact with this website. Google Analytics uses cookies for its operation in accordance with <a target=_blank href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">Google's policy</a>.

<h2>3. Web beacons</h2>

We may also occasionally use "Web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs," "Web bugs," "1-pixel gifs," etc.) that allow us to collect non-personal information about your response to our e-mail communications, and for other purposes. Web beacons are tiny images, placed on a Web page or e-mail, that can tell us if you've gone to a particular area on our website. For example, if you've given us permission to send you e-mails, we may send you an e-mail urging you to use a certain feature on our website. If you do respond to that e-mail and use that feature, the Web beacon will tell us that our e-mail communication with you has been successful. We do not collect any personal health information with a Web beacon, and do not link Web beacons with any other personal health information you've given us.<p>

<h2>4. E-mails</h2>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> uses a third-party vendor to help us manage some of our e-mail communications with you. While we do supply this vendor with e-mail addresses of those we wish them to contact, your e-mail address is never used for any purpose other than to communicate with you on our behalf. When you click on a link in an e-mail, you may temporarily be redirected through one of the vendor's servers (although this process will be invisible to you) which will register that you've clicked on that link, and have visited our website. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> never shares any information, other than your e-mail address, with our third-party e-mail vendor, which does not share these e-mail addresses with anyone else.<p>

Even if you have given us permission to send e-mails to you, you may revoke that permission at any time by following the "unsubscribe" information at the bottom of the e-mail.

<h2>5. Evaluation and research</h2>

We will periodically ask users to complete surveys asking about their experiences with features of the website. Our surveys ask visitors for demographic information such as age, gender, and education, but will not request that users provide specific information about any medical condition. We use survey information for research and quality improvement purposes, including helping <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> to improve information and services offered through the website. In addition, users giving feedback may be individually contacted for follow-up due to concerns raised during the course of such evaluation. Demographic information and Web log data may be stored for future research and evaluation.

<h2>6. Messages and transactions</h2>

Comments or questions sent to us using e-mail or secure messaging forms will be shared with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> staff and health care professionals who are most able to address your concerns. We will archive your messages once we have made our best effort to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response.<p>

When you use a service on the secure section of this website to interact directly with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> health care professionals, some information you provide may be documented in your medical record, and available for use to guide your treatment as a patient.

<h2>7. Children</h2>

We do not knowingly allow users under the age of 13 to create accounts on this site.

<h2>8. Disclosures</h2>

We may disclose personal information to any person performing audit, legal, operational, or other services for us. We will use information which does not identify the individual for these activities whenever feasible. Information disclosed to vendors or contractors for operational purposes may not be re-disclosed to others by such a vendor or contractor.<p>

We may disclose personal information when required to do so by a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We may disclose personal information as we deem it appropriate to protect the safety of an individual or for an investigation related to public safety or to report an activity that appears to be in violation of law. We may disclose personal information to protect the security and reliability of this site, and to take precautions against liability.

<h2>9. Other requests to limit use and disclosure of your personal information</h2>

State and federal laws may allow you to request that we limit our uses and disclosures of your personal information for treatment, payment, and health care operations purposes. However, by law, we do not have to agree to your request.
