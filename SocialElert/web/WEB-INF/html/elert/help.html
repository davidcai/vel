<h2>General</h2>

<h3>What is <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>?</h3>

<invoke method=appTitle></invoke> is a new, free service that enables you to interact with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> appointment schedulers with the aim of expediting the dates of your planned medical procedures.  <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> offers several online and offline communications by which schedulers can send you eLerts notifying you when new openings that match your case profile become available.

<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>How does the <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> system work?</h3>
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke> is an easy way to stay connected and receive notifications regarding last minute available appointments. The system works through the web browser of any device including your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

<h3>Who is handling my case?</h3>
Some aspects of the system are handled automatically, but ultimately a decision is made by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> staff (schedulers).
<p>
Please be aware that accepting an eLert does not guarantee receipt of the appointment. The scheduler reviews all applications and ultimately decides on the best match for the opening. If you are not granted the date, you remain on queue and will be notified of future availability.

<h3>Is my privacy protected?</h3>
<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of this website. Please review the details of the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> of the website.

<h3>What are the requirements for using <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>?</h3>
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke> can be accessed through the Internet from your computer and your mobile phone (all browsers and all carriers). <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> is for <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> members only. Access to <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> is free, however, data charges may apply. Please check with your mobile provider.

<h3>How do I cancel a subscription?</h3>
You may choose to unsubscribe from receiving eLerts for a particular procedure.
To do so, check the box next to the subscription you would like to unsubscribe from or remove, then press the Unsubscribe / Remove button. The subscription will be deleted from your Subscriptions list as well as from the entire <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> system, so you will not receive any eLerts regarding that procedure.
Note: unsubscribing from an eLert or removing it cannot be undone.

<h3>How do I stop receiving notifications?</h3>
You can go to your subscriptions page in the eLert tab and remove your subscriptions.  For individual channel changes, you can go to your <a href="/profile/alert-timeline">Alert Timeline</a> and unclick the channels that you want to remove from your notification list.

<h3>What if you receive two elerts at the same time for two different subscriptions. How to respond to the first eLert?</h3>
If you feel you have not responded to a message or are unsure of which message to respond to, check <a href="/patient/wall">your Wall</a>. From there, you can either respond to any open messages, or you can verify that your message was received.

<h3>Are there differences in using a mobile browser or web browser on other devices?</h3>
There are some limitations to the mobile version. For example, the mobile version does not allow you to upload photos to your profile.  All other main functions are operational.

<h3>Are there differences in browser versions?</h3>
Some older browsers may not render <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> correctly, especially Internet Explorer 6 or earlier. For ultimate experience, we recommend you upgrade your browser to the latest version.

<h3>What to do if I replied to the eLert with accept and meant decline?</h3>
You cannot change your response in the system; however a scheduler will call you if you are ultimately selected and you can change your mind during the conversation. You may also contact support.

<h3>What to do if I replied to the eLert with decline and meant accept?</h3>
You cannot change your response in the system, however, if you accidentally declined, and want to see if the appointment is still available, please contact support.

<h3>What if I can't find a subscription I already created?</h3>
You can access your subscriptions under the eLerts tab.  If you don't see one there that you created, it's possible that the scheduler may have removed the item availability.  Please contact support if you need further help.

<h3>What if I don't see a procedure?</h3>
If you don't see your procedure, please ensure that the procedure name is spelled correctly, or contact support for additional help.

<h3>What if I have multiple procedures?</h3>
If you are undergoing multiple procedures, select the primary one (or either) and through the verification process both will be added.

<h3>What if my doctor is not listed?</h3>
Use the option "my doctor is not listed" when signing up to an eLert.

<h3>What if I subscribed, but I never receive an eLert?</h3>
eLerts are sent to candidates when the system finds a matching opening.  First, check <a href="/patient/wall">your Wall</a> for any eLerts.  If you did not receive an eLert on your Wall, there may have not been an opening available for you.  

<h3>I declined an eLert, but it shows that I accepted it; or I accepted, but now I have to decline</h3>
Please contact support.

<h2>Text messaging</h2>

<h3>What is text messaging?</h3>
Text messaging, also known as "texting" or SMS, refers to the exchange of brief written messages on mobile phones over cellular networks. The term SMS is also used as a synonym for all types of short text messaging, as well as the user activity itself, in many parts of the world.

<h3>How does text messaging work in <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>?</h3>
Text messaging is one of the optional notification channels in the system. When you have a mobile phone in your contact details, you can receive text message eLerts.

<h3>What do I need to do to receive text messages?</h3>
Verify that you have text plan for your mobile phone.
Ensure that your mobile phone number is listed in your Profile page, and that you have selected to receive the text notifications in your <a href="/profile/alert-timeline">Alert Timeline</a>. Also, make sure not to enter a home or office number as your mobile as they typically cannot receive text messages.

<h3>Can I stop receiving the text messaging from my mobile?</h3>
Yes, you can modify your <a href="/profile/alert-timeline">Alert Timeline</a>, or remove your mobile number from the system.

<h3>Do charges apply?</h3>
Text message charges may apply from your mobile provider. Please check with your carrier.

<h3>How do I reply to an eLert I received via text message?</h3>
To accept the appointment, simply respond to the text message with the single word YES.
To decline, respond to the text message with the single word NO.
<p>
Alternatively, you can respond with the pound symbol (#) followed by the four-digit code of the text message you received followed by a space and the word YES or NO (e.g. #0013 YES).  An SMS confirmation of your response should arrive within no more than a minute or two.

<h3>How do I respond to a previously sent eLert?</h3>
If you want to respond to a previous eLert (earlier than the latest one you received) you need to include in your response the code of the particular eLert you are responding to. The format of your response must be: pound symbol (#) followed by the four-digit code followed by a space and the word YES or the word NO (e.g. #0014 NO).
If you are using a smartphone capable of internet access, you can alternatively click on the link in the SMS to access the mobile interface.


<h3>I received a "Code:0 Bad phone error" when replying to an eLert by SMS</h3>
This is a known problem with certain Android phones running on Sprint. This indicates an error in sending your message. Try resending your message until you don't see this error. If the problem persists, use <a href="/patient/wall">your Wall</a> to respond to the eLert instead.



<h2>Twitter</h2>

<h3>What is the Twitter channel?</h3>
You can receive eLerts on Twitter in direct message format. These messages never appear on your Twitter feed, and are not visible to your followers; they can be accessed by logging in to Twitter and clicking on the Direct messages link in your Profile.

<h3>How do I respond to an eLert from Twitter?</h3>
First, ensure that your Twitter channel has been enabled in <a href="/profile/contact-info">your profile</a>.
To accept the appointment, respond to the eLert in a direct message containing the single word YES.

<invoke method=appTitle></invoke> confirms your answer in a direct message response.

<h3>Are the Twitter messages viewable to the Public?</h3>
