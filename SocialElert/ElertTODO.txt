enable communications between roles: e.g. scheduler->patient, scheduler->doctor, etc.
  show messages+replies on user's roles.


KP requests:
+ option to select all checkboxes in tables, unless for delete.
- graphs to be more 3D. check Google graph control.
- clarify to the patient how to respond to earlier SMS messages (FAQ?)
- when creating elert: allow empty procedure field.
  need way to semantically differentiate between "cancellation" and "blank opening".
  must make it clear that entering procedure make sense due to resource matching.
- ability to record elert without exact time of day (i.e. entering only a date)
- Option for scheduler to send msg to patient when the scheduler is changing/deleting the patient's sub.
  confirmation window before deletion.
- Physician role/tab
- elert notif templates (allow schedulers to edit notifs before sending)
  
- VerifySubscriptionPage (in scheduler view)
  - show when the subscription was created
  - show and allow to change service area, but only one of home service areas
- New opening page:
  - validate that physicians chosen cover necessary specialties for the procedures chosen
- Unresolved openings
  - depict perishable in table.
  - highlighting of important data (red)
? option to "resend eLert". remove older eLert + its open notifs?. Create new one.

= FAQ: add TOC links at top of page
= in email eLerts. indicate "reply with only YES/NO to indicate availability" instead of the generic "reply with codes"
= sending messages to patients doesn't seem to work.
- governor: invite patients/scheduler/governor page. Send Welcome email with username/password. See script doc for text of this email.
    scheduler: can invite patients
    extend Admin level page. allow limiting roles/groups, setting default msg/title.
= Scheduler procedures page: need to sort alphabetically. Break by proc type. show all proc types.
  - screen A: for each service area, list all proc types with # of linked procedures to the service area. link to screen B
  - screen B: allow mapping all procs of proc type to the facilities of the service area.
  - need to be integrated in guided setup
  = scheduler: removed san diego from home service areas, still seeing procs in mapping.
    happens because procs are still linked to SD with wt=0 and method returns them.
= governor to see list of service areas and assign schedulers to them.
  do not allow scheduler to choose their own home service area.
  (0) invitation form for governor to invite scheduler to a certain home/neighboring service area. also enter NUID.
- Custom procedures need to be mapped to a service area.
= mandate at least one home service area. but only if there's at least one service area defined in system.
  otherwise, give msg in various screens that setting service area is needed.

NTH
- Patient home page: If no subscriptions entered yet by patient, give explanation of the system (FAQ)
  "What's an eLert?" "How does an eLert work?", etc.
  then point user to the new subscription page

NOTIFS:
- consolidate the code that generates the notifs into one class/control. use page containment. (now repeated in WallPage)
- ConfirmNotif: include map of facility on Wall and in email
- Twitter message:
  - If Dr name(s) is too long, use the "no doctor" version of msg to save chars.

UI
- single color icons in linkbars. Use black icon-set.
  need to have ResourcePage to serve images. Allow sub-app to override and redirect icons.
  this way, can control the standard icons of pencil, etc.
- H2 headers for procedure types in scheduler and governor procedures pages

- usability issue:
  when creating new subscription, step 5, when indicating availability, need to auto-select the radio button.
  same when entering "original date". auto select the radio button.

- When terminating user, need to make sure that their eLerts are not considered for appointments.
  also mark their record as DELETED in their profile page (of scheduler view)

NICE TO HAVE:
=============

- For patient:
  - page of Facility. show map. link from various places, esp. subscription.
  - page of Service Area to show map with facilities therein.

- Cartoon like FAQ on how to use the system. Show when logging in first.
  "What is My eLert?"
  "How does it work?"
  "Where do I start?"
