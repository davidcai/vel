At <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, we care about protecting your privacy. We have established the
following policy to explain what information we collect about you, how we use it and
how we safeguard it. We may revise this policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes
in the law, our collection and use practices, the features of our websites or technology.
Therefore, you may want to review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most
current policies and practices.
<br><br>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

The types of personally identifiable information that we collect about you include: name,
address, email address, telephone number, fax number, and information about your interests
in and use of various products, programs, and services. Portions of our site are accessible
only to persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information.
<br><br>

In some situations, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might
submit a person's name and email address to send an invitation to join <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>. The types of
personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these
pages include: recipient's name, address, email address and telephone number.
<br><br>

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our
site such as the type of browser you are using (e.g. FireFox, Internet Explorer), the
type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows or Mac OS), your IP address
and the web page from which you came. We use your IP address to help identify
you and to gather broad demographic information about you and in order to administer
and optimize and to diagnose problems with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>.
<br><br>

Each time you sell through your website on <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, PayPal sends <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> a
notification of the transaction by means of Instant Payment Notification (IPN).
These notifications include details such as the names, amounts and prices of the items sold,
as well as your customer's name, address and email address.
We use these notifications to verify and log your transactions, maintain your inventory and
email you and your buyers confirmation notices.
<invoke method=appOwner></invoke>'s servers will only react to transactions that originated from <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>;
all other transactions are ignored and discarded.
<br><br>

To best protect your privacy, <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> does not collect any financial information directly
from you. Instead, we choose to work with PayPal, a leading online transaction
facilitator, whenever such interaction is necessary. Any financial information you
provide to PayPal (e.g. credit card or bank account numbers) is not shared with us and
never stored on our servers. Please refer to PayPal's site for information on how your
financial information is handled and protected.
<br><br>
