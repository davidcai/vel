    rests with Subscriber. Subscriber shall be solely liable for any damage resulting
    from any infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm resulting
    from such a submission. By submitting material to any public area of <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>,
    Subscriber automatically grants, or warrants that the owner of such material has

    through <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, or elsewhere on the World Wide Web of the Internet for the purpose of promoting Subscriber or the services of <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>,
    for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material. Subscriber also permits
    any other Subscriber to access, view, store or reproduce the material for that
    Subscriber's personal use. Subscriber hereby grants <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> the right to edit, copy,
    publish and distribute any material made available on <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> by Subscriber.
    Subscriber may end this license by deleting Subscriber's material from <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>.
    Upon removal of the material by Subscriber, <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall immediately cease all future use of the removed material,
    including its publication on <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall not be held responsible for removing copies of the material that are

	and all other proprietary rights, as well as, any and all applications, renewals, extensions,
	restorations and re-instatements thereof, now or hereafter in force and effect worldwide.

<h3>7. Monitoring</h3>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, including chat rooms and forums, to determine compliance with
this Agreement and any operating rules established by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> and to satisfy any law,
regulation or authorized government request. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall have the right in its sole
discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted

the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable.

Subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, its affiliates and their

Subscriber or Subscriber's Account.

<h3>9. Termination</h3>

Either <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> or Subscriber may terminate this Agreement at any time. Without limiting
the foregoing, <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall have the right (but not the obligation) to immediately and without
notice delete or deactivate Subscriber's Account, block Subscriber's email or IP address,
or otherwise terminate Subscriber's access to or use of <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>,
in the event of any conduct by Subscriber which <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, in its sole discretion, considers
to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by Subscriber of this Agreement.
<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> shall not be liable to Subscriber or any third party for any termination of
Subscriber's access to <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, nor will <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> be obliged to refund Subscriber for any unused portion of

The provisions of Sections 5(C), 5(D), 5(E), 5(F), 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 16 shall survive

If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason
unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. 

<h3>11. Dealings with Organizations and Individuals</h3>

Subscriber's interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions,
warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between Subscriber

other Subscribers, Subscriber hereby releases <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, its officers, employees, agents and
successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind
or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising
out of or in any way related to such disputes. If Subscriber is a California
resident, Subscriber hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which states that
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have
materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

<h3>12. Trademarks</h3>

<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, its logos and slogans are trademarks of <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>. All rights reserved. All other
trademarks appearing on <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> are the property of their respective owners.

<h3>13. Third Party Content</h3>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and
Subscribers. Accordingly, <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> has no more editorial control over such content than
does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements,
services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by
third parties, including information providers, Subscribers or any other user of
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not
of <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>. Neither <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> nor any third party provider of information guarantees the
accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or
fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to Section 6 above for the complete
provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.)
<br><br>

In many instances, the content available through <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> represents the
opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, Subscriber, or other
user not under contract with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> neither endorses nor is responsible for the
accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>
by anyone other than authorized <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> employee spokespersons while acting in their
official capacities. Under no circumstances will <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> be liable for any loss or damage
caused by a Subscriber's reliance on information obtained through <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>.
It is the responsibility of Subscriber to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or
usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other content available through
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>. Please seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, regarding
the evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice or other content.
<br><br>

In some instances, the content available through <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, including content supplied by third parties,
may be suited for adults only
and may include pictures and materials that some Subscribers may find offensive.
This type of content may include but is not limited to nudity, violence or explicit language.
By posting or viewing such content, Subscriber hereby asserts that Subscriber is over the age of 18, is not offended by such material,
and that it is legal to view such material in Subscriber's community, town, city, state or country.
Subscriber takes full responsibility for his actions and removes <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> and its agents from all liability.

<h3>14. Linked Sites and Advertising</h3>

In establishing hypertext links to <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, Subscriber must not represent in any way, expressly
or by implication, that Subscriber has received the endorsement, sponsorship or support of <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>
or <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, including its respective employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders.
<br><br>

If <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> has provided links or pointers to other websites, no inference or assumption should
be made and no representation should be implied that <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> is connected with, operates or
controls these websites. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy,
completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site.
<br><br>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> is not responsible for the content or practices of third party websites that may be
linked to <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>. <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> may also be linked to other websites operated by companies affiliated or
connected with <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>. When visiting other websites, however, Subscriber should refer to each
such website's individual "Terms of Use" and not rely on this Agreement. 
<br><br>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> takes no responsibility for third party advertisements which are posted on <invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, nor does
it take any responsibility for the goods or services provided by its advertisers.

<h3>15. RSS feeds</h3>

RSS is a free service offered by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> for non-commercial use. Any other uses, including
without limitation the incorporation of advertising into or the placement of advertising associated
with or targeted towards the RSS content, are strictly prohibited. Subscriber must use the RSS feeds as provided
by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>, and may not edit or modify the text, content or links supplied by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>.
<br><br>

The RSS service may be used only with those platforms from which a functional link is made
available that, when accessed, takes the viewer directly to the display of the full article on the <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> website.
Subscriber may not display the RSS content in a manner that does not permit successful linking to, redirection to
or delivery of the applicable <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> web page. Subscriber may not insert any intermediate page, splash page or other
content between the RSS link and the applicable <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> web page. 
<br><br>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> retains all ownership and other rights in the RSS content, and any and all logos and trademarks
used in connection with the RSS service. Subscriber must provide attribution to the appropriate <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> website in connection
with Subscriber's use of the RSS feeds. If Subscriber provides this attribution using a graphic, Subscriber must use the appropriate
website's logo that has been incorporated into the RSS feed.
<br><br>

<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> reserves the right to discontinue providing any or all of the RSS feeds at any time and to require
Subscriber to cease displaying, distributing or otherwise using any or all of the RSS feeds for any reason including,
without limitation, Subscriber's violation of any provision of this Agreement. <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> assumes no liability for any of
Subscriber's activities in connection with the RSS feeds or for Subscriber's use of the RSS feeds in connection with
Subscriber's website. 

<h3>16. Privacy and Information Disclosure</h3>

Subscriber's use of <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> signifies acknowledgement of and agreement to <invoke method=appOwner></invoke>'s Privacy Policy.
Subscriber further acknowledges and agrees that <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> may, in its sole discretion, preserve or
disclose any of the Subscriber's content, as well as Subscriber's information, such as email
addresses, IP addresses, timestamps, and other such information, if required to do so by law
or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
comply with legal process; enforce this Agreement; respond to claims that any content
violates the rights of third parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
<invoke method=appTitle></invoke>, its Subscribers or the general public.
<invoke method=appOwner></invoke> disclaims all responsibility, and will not be liable to Subscriber, however, for any
disclosure of that information by any such third party.

<h3>17. Miscellaneous</h3>

This Agreement and any operating rules for <invoke method=appTitle></invoke> established by <invoke method=appOwner></invoke> constitute
