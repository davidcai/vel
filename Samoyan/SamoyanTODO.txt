
- Import users:
  - verification: must check that inputed fields are not shorter/longer than minimum/maximum allowed, e.g. id/password, etc.
  - consolidate with InviteUsers page.
  - save last msg on user/fed object. retrieve when next using form.

Retina Images:
- allow uploading images to app via web interface. e.g. icon to be served by "/cmd/subcmd"
  need way to export this data though so can transfer to another installation.
  can store images linked to Federation object with name=uri.
- call "full" sizer before saving or after uploading.
  currently, doing this in getParameterImage(name, w,h)
  or take from dimensions of db field def.
  need to worry about retina images requiring 2x the normal size. must have enough raw pixels.
  
- More admin permissions: Edit permissions, Assign groups, System configuration, Edit other admins
  create Administrators, Technical Support group.
- Add Dr NUID (all KP employees) and specialty (physicians) into profile page.
- look into Perforce
= Button control:
  - feature to require Confirmation. "Remove" -> "Wait [3]" -> "Confirm [10]" -> "Remove"
    apply to various delete buttons
= ZHIBIT: if no SEO, do not list in Google. SiteMapXML page and robots tag.

= quiet time


- integrate tyntec.com as a SMS provider.

------------------------

- Take LESS colors/font from Federation object rather than code. Create customize screen for admin. Allow app to extend with additional LESS vars.

- phone verification: do not ask for verification if same mobile # was verified already.
- mini content management system: allow admin to edit FAQ, help files etc. similar to Zhibit free form pages.
  how can we support templates (Apache Velocity?) with it?
- internal support ticket system.

- Notifications: field "StatusDate" is multi-purpose. Need SentDate, DeliveredDate, ToSendDate in addition to StatusDate.

- Notif infrastructure
  - On Action received, new notif added: remove future unsent notifs on same eventID, (but not same BatchID?)
    e.g. "appt is no longer avail" should suppress future "elert" notifs.
  - or BEFORE SENDING NOTIF, check there are no later-dated Sent/Delivered with same EventID.
    Also need to check there are no later-dated actions.
  - Need to know notif ID when performing action.
    - Need to post _notif_ rather than actual params. -- or post in addition to params.
    - Then load params from notif table in request context. -- then no need to do this.
    - post back _notif_ in ActionListControl and on _action_, can perform deletion of future notifs.
  - When adding x.co link to short text, use only the _notif_ param.

- Mark labels of required fields. redo TwoColControl to support label column and datacolumn (webPage). with chaining. including "required()".
  - various write methods of WebPage to return "this". Will allow writing into data column
? TypeAheadControl to be its own InputControl class.
- inline form validation with JS:
  - re-enable JS code in document.ready.
  - Support bubble over INPUT with message where there's inline error. Add "msg" param to control.setRegExp
  - TypeAhead to allow forcing requirement that text must have corresponding key. then show inlineerror.
  - set RegExp and Mandatory in various forms.
  - Need to support conditional checks: e.g. if "Enabled" is checked, then username,password,etc. fields are mandatory.

- GuidedSetup infrastructure.
  - in WelcomePage, set default guided setup pages to: profile, mobile, phone. only if channels are enabled.
  - Customizable Start and Complete messages (via inheritance)

- insert trackback #0001 only into messages that are actionable. E.g. the phone verification SMS should not include this.

- Help section: must be role based: e.g. only governors to see governor help pages.

- "quiet time." default to 10pm-6am and give users the option to change.

- Orphaned records:
  - When referring to a table, need to pass to it that it is being referred by a column on another table.
  - On the table itself, need to mark it as "removeOrphaned". do not on the relationship.
  - When deleting from a table linking to another, need to call checkOrphans on the other table.
  - Relevant tables: ProcedureTypes, Regions, Permissions, Resources
- Link management in a new Links table: Key1, Key2, Weight, RelationshipName
  RelationshipName column to be the name of the linktable.
  Indexes to be Name+key1, Name+Key2.
  Links to be managed inside a LinkBean object. then can add/remove/retain UUIDs to/from the list and save it.
  support all kinds of relationships: 1 to 1, 1 to N, non/owner, N to M, lock delete

- patient "Push notif" page (opt in/out of all push notifs):
  elaborate more on the description
- Patient alertTimeline:
  - add on/off switch per channel

--------------------
Mid term features
--------------------

- SmartPhone nav menu to drop down from top of page.

- additional email-to-sms carriers at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/
- IE7:
  - doesn't like "inherit" in CSS.
  - set cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 on tables. esp. top tab bar, and controls. can use jquery for that.
- buttons should be placed inside the 2 col form in the input column, i.e. aligned with the edit boxes.

? Force unique "email" for a user. Need to enforce in invite/import as well. Can then simplify PasswordReset
  Maybe have option in admin console for this.

? Add @variables to LESS for user-agent tags. Can then use "guards" in LESS for conditionals instead of the use of classes on the BODY tag.
  same with @uri instead of BODY[uri^='']
  same with @screen-width, @screen-height, etc.
  ? then can remove condition of user-agent in SocialElert.LessPage and move it into the LESS file.

- use text/plain in emails as alternative to HTML content. call renderText in parallel to renderSimpleHTML

- Page authorization should be centralized in Dispatcher (allow attaching filter), but still allow pages to designate own security checks.
  have admin screen to define security on pages by command prefix.

- POST redirect: support param _method_=POST when channel!=web
- Use _method_=post&_auth_=... in email/sms/etc. links to the notification page that do not require login
  make valid for short time only

Voxeo:
- writeEncodeDate/DateTime/DateOrTime in voice to use long version of date.
  - use SAY-AS for writing dates

- Deprecate use of ViewTableControl in favor of DataTableControl.

- Patient.ProcedureSearch: tree-view of procedure types > procedures

Database:
  ? Add getRelated methods on DataBean level, e.g. patient.getPrescriptions
    - DataBean to support loadReferred("PropName") to perform loading of bean.
      also support loadReferredMany to return List of bean.
      Can then have user.loadGroups(), area.loadRegion()
    - Also, getReferred("PropName") to return IDs rather than load the objects.
    - PropDef.refersTo("Table", "ViaLinkTable") will allow doing get/load of related objects.
  - Permissions to be linked to Users and Groups separately in two different link tables.
    then can handle deletion of relationships automatically.
    but not auto-removal of orphaned permissions since those can be linked to the other table.
  ? automatically manage "Removed" flag on objects. when removing an object with references, mark it as "Removed".
    don't return it in queries.
    example: user.terminated, procedure that's been removed, etc.
    bean to support .isRemoved(). disallow save/open on such a bean.
    but only if column "Removed" is defined. otherwise, throw exception when can't remove.

Mobile:
- bottom bar has room for only 5 tab icons. reduce size if more.
- Back button in title area.

- If can't locate trackback, need to give error msg back to user.
  - need to know locale so can send error msg.
    ? lookup user by mobile phone number / Twitter handle / etc., take locale from there. Default to server locale if not found.

- ContactInfoPage:
  - Need to verify all channels: e.g. Facebook requires app install, Twitter requires follow, Email requires code, etc.
    - TwitterPage: wizard. Verify that can follow the user. specific step to ask user to press "Follow".
    - EmailPage: wizard with verification. Ask for password to confirm identity.
  - Because of that, can't edit field if the channel is inactive (admin setting)

- security:
  - Invalidate all user's auth tokens when changing password, or somehow encrypt password hash in authtoken and compare on auth.
    May need longer auth token to store this. But then need to modify AuthTokens table.
  - UUID cookies are subject to brute force attacks
    - encrypt session cookie with bcrypt: set cookie to UUID+bcrypt(UUID), validate in RequestContext. Must work very fast though because happens on every request.
  - user object to have property "secret" to be used for encryption/hashing. init on creation of user record: 16 random chars.
  - Social eLert typeaheads need to be restricted, at the very least to logged in users.

notifs to be able to return "originator", e.g. email address+name, phone number, etc. to show in outgoing notifs.
  will allow sending message from Doctor to Patient.
  default to Setup.getAppTitle
  SmsServer.sendMessage to accept originator name as param, and/or add default originator in EmailServer.
  make it work in SMS too. Esp. in AT&T "FRM:Social eLert".

CONTROLS:
- RichEdit control does not work on mobile devices. Find solution (e.g. text to HTML)
  "You may lose formatting if you edit this field on this device"
- Typeahead: on selection of choice, if there are more than one matches (i.e. choice is substring of another), the dropdown remains visible. 
- DatePicker, TimePicker.
- ViewTableControl:
  - support "compressing" columns on phones = merge two columns into one
  - more paging options: numeric paging, etc.
  - sorting icons for column headers.
- ActionListControl: action links in email to be "mailto://...?body=YES"
  need to set correct addressee (with trackback), subject (with "Re:") and body.

- generalize searchByText in DataBeanStore. Use regexp instead of LIKE %text%

- Admin pages:
  - report: user alert timeline prefs. naive impl may be slow. need to consider fed level prefs, if that of user is not defined.
  _ AdHocMessage form: with JS, hide/show subject field based on email checkbox.


? on general exception: dispatcher to treat it as webform exception with "general error"

- WelcomeNotif (on signup): allow recipient to respond "LOCK" if they did not open the account.
  - Similarly for password/email/username change notifs

- "Email this report"
  - screen for composing email.
  - execute report page with Channel.EMAIL, put content into richedit. allow user to edit.
  - automatically add own's email address as recipient.
  - how can render graph images? Switch from Google chart to http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart ?
    see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265777/what-is-the-best-open-source-java-charting-library-other-than-jfreechart
  - Embed images inline in the email.
- "Export to Excel"

Notifications:
- channel timeline:
  - admin config screen: if disabling channel, use jquery to fade out the checkboxes in the same row.
  - allow channel disabling in user timeline page as well. or global on/off switch for all notif channels at once.
- admin:EventTrailPage
- unify TaskManager and Executors. keep stats for UnifiedExecutor. also allow naming the threads, setting priority, etc.
- security check on incoming messages: verify sender matches user of notif. e.g. the FROM email address, or the caller ID phone number. 
? separate table for NotifSchedule to hold notifID, futureSendDate. will remain small instead of querying big table.

--------------------
Longer term features
--------------------

- disable spellchecking on certain edit fields, e.g. login id. esp. on iphone.

Generic WALL concept
- need way to record outgoing notifs and incoming actions on the user's wall in conversation view.
  - also for admin to see conversations
  - idea: page to support method getEventID. If returned, save interaction to database (new Wall table?) after successful POST commit with action,
    and after GET render for push channels only. can return DoseID for example.
  - outgoing notif / incoming actions admin reports to run over system log?
- Need additional push channel: Wall. User can't customize its timeline. take from global setting.
  allow admin to "lock" channels: user can't customize timeline. useful for Wall,Email.
  - Wall channel to use renderSimpleHTML.
  ? Wall database table? Or rely on Notification table record?
  - also need to render replies to the Wall. so for example, asking for reason for skipping drug.

_ on error, autofocus on the edit box with the error.
_ new concept for errors:
  - mark all fields with error
  - popup a box above/below them with the error message when focus in on them

IMAGES:
- ImagePage to store rendering of new sizes on the Image object. Retrieve on next request.
  Image object to support multiple layers.
- when printing image tag, if the layer exists, use the width/height of the image as width/height of IMG tag.

Merge ImportUsersPage with InviteUsersPage. Instead of "Recipients" can also have CSV file.

DataBeanStore:
- method to cache something that is sensitive to a certain col=value combo.
  then all getByProcedureID can be cached.
  need to keep flag on the column that it is an "index". detect changes on insert/save. then invalidate cache.
  getByColumn("ProcedureID", UUID) to Check if column is an index, only then use cache.
- Using UUID as clustered primary key causes insertion not to be at end of table, causing paging problems.
  Need a sequencial ID field as the clustered index, or no clustering at all.
- Caching for getAllIDs requires invalidatePrefix due to sort column.
  Can happens in other situations as well (for caching indexes?). Restore usage of invalidatePrefix? Will make it incompatible with MemCache.
  But will still be able to send invalidations between servers if keeping current cache system.
  need to invalidate on insert, remove, or update of sort column. Mandate sort column to be defined as index column.
- LinkStore
  - Implement PermissionLink as LinkStore? But linking to either UserID or GroupID. Will need two tables.
  - LinkStore: weight column to support UUID, integer, string.
- Caching for queryByColumn. consider sort column as well.
  cacheKey = "bean.colquery:SORTCOL=+-.INDEXCOL=VALUE"
  invalidateRegEx?

IMAGES
- Image upload control
  - link for "edit" (cropping)
  _ support drag and drop
  _ auto-upload with progress bar
- get/validateParameterImage to check that user owns "current" image. See !$! markers.
- when setting NULL on an image, its version number reverts to 0. need to keep Version on Prop table instead.
  can then compare versions when setting property, to prevent unnecessary writes.

- Breadcrumb management. Track the pages a user visits, and offer BACK/CANCEL buttons that can take him to the previous step.
  esp. needed on iphone.
  - Need to keep queue of crumbs in session memory.
    allow various pages to insert themselves into queue. or do automatically for GET requests.
  - on GET, if page rendered (i.e. no redirect) - add to breadcrumbs.
    Allow page to override isBreadcrumb() then don't and/or allow page to return its breadcrumb URL
    do not add page if already at top of queue
  - do not render BACK/CANCEL buttons when queue is empty.
  - breadcrumbs should be based on sessionID, not userID
    need to worry about multiple-windows on same session (open link in new tab). Will break this model.
  - Allow special URL /go-back?steps=2 to extract from queue and redirect user.
    - Reimplement Cancel button and GoBackRedirect to both point to this page
  

- SMS Proxy
  = Can we have different callbacks for different program IDs? get brent to contact their support. or do so myself.
  - implement as Samoyan app, or
    allow any one server/federation to serve as SMS Proxy. Then all others can point to it.
  - accept from app by http post: msg text, recipient phone#, locale, callback URL, credentials.
  - generate unique 4-digit code for phone number. append it to msg text as #1234.
  - on incoming, detect 4-digit code, then call callback URL with response text as additional param. pass same credentials.
  - if no 4-digit code, accept if only one msg (that was unanswered) was sent to this phone# in last X minutes.
    otherwise, send back error message, on same locale, asking the user to re-respond with the code first.
    "Attention! Your msg was NOT processed because we couldn't identify the msg you replied to. Please re-reply to the original msg and
     prepend its 4-digit code before your reply, e.g. "1234 Yes".
  - keep multiple provider settings. forward msg based on phone# (e.g. US provider, Europe provider, etc.)
  ? know to use email to send/receive messages. will then need to pass in recipient's mobile provider


x checkbox submittal: be able to figure out a checkbox is unchecked after submit.
  in essence have 3 states: unsent, checked, unchecked.

- delivery failure management.
  - keep table DeliveryFailures to hold Channel, Address, FailingSince, ?FailCount, Diagnostic.
  - update in Notifier on failures and on success (delete record)
  - Preempt messages before sending, if failing for too long.
  - For email and SMS.


- SMS/Phone Countries: do not send SMS or phone calls to countries not supported by providers
  - link SMS provider to countries they can operate on.
  - limit phone edit fields in ContactInfoPage. if only one country, can hide prefix dropdown.
  - check when sending SMS, phone calls.

- CountryStore / phones:
  - Keep Phone number validating RegEx in Countries table. USA = [0-9]{10}. validate in validatePhone and before sending SMS/calls.
  - Also keep format, USA = (###) ###-####, israel = 0##-###-####.
    create method writePhone
- Profile page to ask for Country, state. Need StateStore CSV.

- Controls
  - need control that can browse hierarchies with json. TreeViewer with fetch into DOM on demand.
  - have typeahead generate jquery events onChange(key, value). then can catch them and populate other control.
  - need FooterControl to mirror the TopBar.
    ? can then move colors defs to controls from #header, #footer.

IMAP reader:
  ?reader to also use persistence: download emails, write to db, then multiple processors to analyze.
  Option for email reader thread to delete messages from the inbox/sent folders of the email server.
  have store IO and connection timeouts in database. default to 60 and 20 secs.

log:
  log "request exception" events. also redirects.
  graphs as display option
  show severity icons next to log entry names.

- Full auditing: when, who updated which property of what object.

- Move "allow remember me" to fed object from inheritance.
- Restrict Configuration pages to "System Configuration" permission only. Do not allow Admins to set this permission.
  Separate the config screens into another tab
- Admin screen for user beans: list/edit all properties (same as in Zhibit)

Notifications:
- remove fed.getOpenMarketDemoPrefix
- let users customize channel delivery per event type (=command)
  - Need table to keep user + command + channels relationship
  - profile screen to allow user to subscribe/unsubscribe from notif types per channel
    - Need webpage to return metaTitle (name of the event such as "Password change notification")
  - allow users to UNSUBSCRIBE/STOP by replying to the notif. Then disable the channel for this notif type.
    - need to update footer of EmailEnvelope with this explanation.
  - also, always accept OK for notifs. then preempt future notifs of same event.

TaskManager:
  support pause/resume, run now.
  delay initial launch of tasks by at least 1 minute after system startup.
  keep props per task, including last execution time. then delay startup accordingly.

- move remainder of non-boot application/platform.properties to a database object,
  - keep only database props, host, ports, debug, ssl, possibly add Server.Name
    update application.properties file in all projects.
  - import/export of settings (all properties on local server + federation object)
  ? better caching for federation object (static var) to reduce need to access cache hashmap.
    on save, set the static var, and clear the cache as well (the latter will affect other servers)
    on load, use static copy if no more than 1sec passed since it was cached
    props inside the object to keep local copies in addition to hashmap.
- cache to automatically control its size based on avail mem. or init it after db init.
    thread to run every one sec, check mem status, clear 1/4 elements and gc, if over max.
    if max==0, disable cache. force 50%-90% range.
    keep 35% of total mem, or 50MB, whichever is greater, free.

Federation support:
  Servers table to keep intranet IP of server
  Each server to have HeartBeat recurring task to store currentTime in Servers table (LastHeartbeat)
  Cache.invalidate to send notifs to other live servers using IP address in Servers table. 
    or keep SMPP session between all servers. Send cache invalidation this way.
  support federation working on same Notifications table. make sure messages are not sent twice.
  special handling of Server.getFederal. send special notifs when federal changed. then can cache better.
  PostedFileOutputStream: need to persist the temp file to the database, not the file system, since consecutive requests can arrive to a different server.
  Captchas rely on cache. Need to move to more persistent storage, or use bcrypt to pass result to client side.

- Support Upgrade process for both app and platform.
  allow plugging in upgradeProcesses to run in order. in-process, bg-job.

NotifRunner: embed CSS in emails inline. See !$! marker

- create Veloxicom website based on our platform.
  allow visitors to play with a sample application using their email, SMS, etc.

- additional channels: WhatsApp.com, Skype chat.

  native mobile app.
  + CSS inheritance

- XML encode of quotes in OpenMarket XML

calendar picker for mass notif. use jquery's?

- DataBean
  - need smarter cache management for relationships.
    // when condition changes, need to clean up cache based on orig and new values of condition column
	// when sort order changes, need to clean up cache based on orig value of condition column
	// when removing, need to clean up cache based on orig value of condition column
	// when inserting, need to clean up cache based on new value of condition column
  - DataBeanStore to support transaction (JDBC commit)
  - remove concept of "invariant" column? not used anymore for caching.
? Integrate internal user management with Tomcat as JAAS/LoginModule.
- support other database engines (MySQL). issues to consider: data encryption, full-text indexing, scalability.
  - tool to extract schema into ANSI-SQL
- support NOT permissions, e.g. "!System administrator". take precedence over white list.

- stay consistent with memcached api. https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/ab0c0537eb1b225263f4ec45ce3133c5de9a94dc/doc/protocol.txt
  data must be serialized. can't store objects.
